# Bathtub model


# melt = flow rate in
# storage = volume capacity of the bathtub
# discharge = k(drainage rate)*melt     ????


discharge = function(melt, storage, k)
{
  # not sure how to set this one up, needs to be something about the sum of previous day melt minus the discharge rate or something?? 
}

#look at Naomi reservoir example 
#we need a term for evap losses
#look at R reservoir package
